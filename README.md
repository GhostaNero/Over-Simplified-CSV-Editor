# Introduction
========================
This program is the course work for Lewis JiaBin Xue's Advanced Higher Computer Science for the sessions 2024-2025. 
Users are not allowed redistribute any work that are in this repo without the permission of the creator. (Myself)

When this code goes public you are free to drop me a dm at my discord (ghostanero) or here to request permission.
Though I doubt anyone will :D.

Anyways, this program is aimed to deliver an oversimplified CSV tool service with a GUI. 
This is done through python, MySQL and Tkinter. I took inspiration from an older project I was doing. 
This program is still rough and unrefined but gets the job done. Its not really flexible in-terms of the CSV it supports.
Well my final project in my free time will probably be a flexible CSV reader.

I would also try and host the MySQL database on the cloud.
Please do not actually use this to store any personal information, it can be hacked easily from another user.

# How to use

======================

This program will load into an log-in / sign up page, that is very self explanatory.
Then when you do log in you will be asked to import a CSV file
Afterward click the refresh to load the data in.

From this point onward you can add, search, delete and alter records by using the tool section and export the csv file via the button.
Pretty easy

Though if you wish to generate a CSV test data, I have also attached the program to do so. It is very simple, just run the file and you will get a CSV file.


# Comments
====================

As I said before this program's DB is not cloud hosted so I will try to change that, also the code is not efficient and done well enough.
I would like to make it more dynamic in the future, but given the inexperience with OOP and my age I am quite proud.

int main(void){
    printf("success");
    return 0
}
